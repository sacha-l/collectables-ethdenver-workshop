# Welcome to the Substrate Collectables Workshop!

This workshop was created for the We Are Developers (Berlin, June 2022) conference and is primarily based on Substrate's [Kitties tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/kitties/pt1/).

In this workshop, you'll learn how to build a custom Substrate blockchain that can mint **Proof of Attendance NFTs**.

To follow along for this workshop, you'll need:

- To have your local environment set up with Rust
- A compiled version of the Node Template. Follow the [setup instructions](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/create-your-first-substrate-chain/#install-required-packages).

## What You'll Learn

* The basic patterns for building and running a Substrate node on your local machine.
* The basics of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as used in Substrate.
* How to write a custom FRAME Pallet which can create NFTs.
	* Create custom types.
	* Manage custom storage.
	* Write custom logic and callable functions.
* Integrate your new pallet into your Substrate runtime.

We have a lot to cover.
So let's get right to it!
