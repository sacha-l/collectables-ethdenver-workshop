# Custom Storage

Our Pallet will use 3 storage items to track all of the state changes.

1. A `StorageValue` named `CountForPoapNfts` which will keep track of the total number of NFTs claimed in the Pallet.
	* This `StorageValue` simply keeps track of a `u64` value that we increment whenever an NFT is claimed. This means we could have up to `18_446_744_073_709_551_615` claimed NFTs in existence.... probably more than we will ever need to worry about. üí™
	* It is worth noting the `ValueQuery` configuration in the `StorageValue`. This basically assumes if there is no value in storage, for example at the start of the network, that we should return the value `0` rather than an option `None`. üìù
2. A `StorageMap` named `PoapCollections` which will map each collection to it's unique information.
	* To keep collections completely unique and easy to look up, the key of our map is the `collection_id` of the claimed NFT. As such, we cannot have two collections with the same `collection_id` since the map will have already been populated by one of them. ‚úÖ
3. A `StorageMap` named `PoapNftsOwned` which will map each user to a list of POAP NFTs they own.
	* The _key_ for this storage map will be a user account: `T::AccountID`.
	* The _value_ for this storage map will be a `BoundedVec` with the `collection_id` of the NFT from the collection they own. This will make it easy to then look up each individual POAP NFT for its information since the `collection_id` is used as the key for the `PoapCollections` map.
	* By using a `BoundedVec`, we ensure that each storage item has a maximum length, which is important for managing limits within the runtime.

#### ** ACTION ITEMS **

Add the following custom storage items to your Pallet.

```rust
/// Keeps track of the number of claimed POAP NFTs in existence.
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type CountForPoapNfts<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, u64, ValueQuery>;

/// Maps the POAP Collection to its unique ID.
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type PoapCollections<T: Config> =
	StorageMap<_, Twox64Concat, [u8; 16], PoapEvent<T>>;

/// Track the POAP NFTs owned by each account.
#[pallet::storage]
pub(super) type PoapNftsOwned<T: Config> = StorageMap<
	_,
	Twox64Concat,
	T::AccountId,
	BoundedVec<[u8; 16], T::MaxPoapOwned>,
	OptionQuery,
>;
```

#### ** SOLUTION **

This should compile successfully by running:

```bash
cargo build -p pallet-template
```

Don't worry about warnings.

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

		#[pallet::constant]
		type StringLimit: Get<u32>;
	}

	// Your Pallet's events.
	#[pallet::event]
	#[pallet::generate_deposit(pub(super) fn deposit_event)]
	pub enum Event<T: Config> {}

	// Your Pallet's error messages.

	pub enum Error<T> {}

	// Your Pallet's callable functions.
	#[pallet::call]
	impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {}
